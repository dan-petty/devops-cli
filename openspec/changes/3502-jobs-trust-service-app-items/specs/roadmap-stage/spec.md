## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The job leaves out the items it must not stage
The job SHALL leave out an item that is not Ready, has the label `needs-split`, fails the check of `roadmap-author-trust`, or depends on an open issue. It SHALL leave out a held item: `origin` or a worktree of the clone has a branch `<type>/<issue>-<slug>` for it. It SHALL leave out an item whose plan is on `origin/<default branch>` or whose change is archived there, matched by the issue number only. The plan SHALL name each item it leaves out and say why.

#### Scenario: Items that are left out
- **WHEN** the filter names a Blocked item, an item with `needs-split`, an item opened by an account with no write access that the jobs do not trust, an item of a bot that no review approved, an item that depends on an open issue, and an item with a pushed branch
- **THEN** the plan stages none of them and gives one reason for each

#### Scenario: The plan is on the default branch and the branch is gone
- **WHEN** `origin/main` holds the folder `openspec/changes/7-stop-the-drop/`, `origin` has no branch for item 7, the record of item 7 holds a `stage.pr` that is merged, and the title of item 7 gives another slug
- **THEN** the plan stages no item, and the reason for item 7 says that its plan is on `main` and names the folder

#### Scenario: The plan is on the default branch and the branch is still there
- **WHEN** `origin/main` holds the folder of item 7 and `origin` still has the staged branch of item 7
- **THEN** the plan stages no item, and item 7 has one reason

#### Scenario: The change is archived
- **WHEN** `origin/main` holds the folder `openspec/changes/archive/2026-10-28-7-stop-the-drop/`
- **THEN** the plan leaves out item 7 and the reason says that its change is archived on `main`

#### Scenario: The issue is closed
- **WHEN** the folder of item 7 is on `origin/main` and item 7 is closed
- **THEN** the plan holds no reason for item 7, because the job reads open items only

#### Scenario: A stale record and no plan on the default branch
- **WHEN** the record of item 7 names a merged `stage.pr` and a branch that is gone, and `origin/main` holds no folder for item 7
- **THEN** the plan stages item 7 again

#### Scenario: Two planned items
- **WHEN** `origin/main` holds the folders of items 7 and 8, and both are Ready bugs
- **THEN** the plan leaves out both, each with its own reason
