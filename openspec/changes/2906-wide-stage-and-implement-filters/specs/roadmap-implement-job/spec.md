# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The job takes a Staged or a Planned item that the filter names
A Staged item SHALL have a recorded branch on `origin` and an open draft pull request. The pair is `implement.branch` and `implement.pr`, else `stage.branch` and `stage.pr`. A Planned item SHALL have no recorded branch on `origin` and its change folder on `origin/<default branch>`. A branch on `origin` makes it Staged. The default filter SHALL be `status=ready` and `effort=low`. `--limit` SHALL default to 1. The job SHALL take the items that the filter names with the highest priority first, and the lowest issue number first among equal priorities.

#### Scenario: The default filter
- **WHEN** the roadmap holds a Staged Ready P1 bug of low effort, a Staged Ready P1 bug of high effort, a Staged Ready P3 feature of low effort, and a Staged Ready P2 bug of medium effort
- **THEN** the plan selects the first item when the limit is 1, and with a limit of 2 it selects the first item and the feature, and it does not name the other two, which the filter does not name

#### Scenario: Priority order
- **WHEN** the roadmap holds a Staged Ready P3 item and a Staged Ready P0 item, both of low effort
- **THEN** the plan selects the P0 item first

#### Scenario: A plan on the default branch and a branch that is gone
- **WHEN** a Ready P1 bug of low effort has a record with a merged `stage.pr` and a `stage.branch` that is not on `origin`, and `origin/main` holds its change folder
- **THEN** the plan selects it as a Planned item, with the branch `fix/<issue>-<slug>` and no pull request, and the slug is the one of the change folder

#### Scenario: A plan on the default branch and a branch that is there
- **WHEN** the staged branch of the item is on `origin` with an open draft, and `origin/main` also holds the change folder
- **THEN** the plan selects the item with its staged branch and its pull request, as a Staged item

#### Scenario: Two Planned items
- **WHEN** two Ready P1 bugs of low effort have their change folders on `origin/main`, and the limit is 2
- **THEN** the plan selects both, the lower number first

#### Scenario: A Planned feature
- **WHEN** a Ready P2 item titled `feat(cli): add a flag`, of low effort, has its change folder on `origin/main` and no branch
- **THEN** the plan selects it as a Planned item with the branch `feat/<issue>-<slug>`
