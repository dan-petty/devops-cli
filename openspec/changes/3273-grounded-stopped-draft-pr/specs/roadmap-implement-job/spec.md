## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A Planned item gets a draft pull request at its first push
The job SHALL push the branch of a Planned item with `-u origin` when it first holds a commit past the default branch, and SHALL open a draft pull request into the default branch at once. The first body SHALL hold the closing keyword of the delivered issue once (`Closes #<issue>`) and no other closing keyword, so a stop leaves a grounded draft. The job SHALL record the branch and the pull request, and then go on as it does for a Staged item. A stop before the first commit SHALL push nothing.

#### Scenario: A stop in the first group
- **WHEN** the step of group 1 reports stopped before any commit
- **THEN** `origin` holds no branch for the item, no pull request opened, the Status is Blocked, and `implement.stopped` is `group 1`

#### Scenario: A stop in the second group
- **WHEN** the step of group 2 reports stopped after group 1 passed
- **THEN** `origin` holds the new branch with the commit of group 1, a draft pull request is open with a body that holds `Closes #<issue>` once, the job writes no later body to it, and the record holds its number

#### Scenario: A retry
- **WHEN** a comment `implement: retry` follows that stop
- **THEN** the plan selects the item with the recorded branch and pull request as a Staged item, and the run takes the branch over

#### Scenario: A draft that GitHub refuses
- **WHEN** GitHub refuses the draft pull request after the push
- **THEN** the job removes the branch from `origin`, stops the item, and the record holds no pull request
