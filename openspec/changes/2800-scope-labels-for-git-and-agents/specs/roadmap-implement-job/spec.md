## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The pull request that delivers the code has the type of the issue
The job SHALL set the title of the pull request, for a Staged item and for a Planned item, to the type and the scope of the title of the issue and its summary, shortened so that the part after the colon has at most 60 characters. The job SHALL leave out the scope when `.github/labels.yml` on the default branch declares no label `scope/<scope>`. The job SHALL set the title in the same call that sets the body `Closes #<issue>`.

#### Scenario: A Staged item
- **WHEN** the staging pull request of a bug has the title `docs(openspec): plan #1 keep every comment` and the job finishes the change
- **THEN** the title of the pull request becomes `fix(roadmap): the job drops a comment`, the title of the issue

#### Scenario: A long summary
- **WHEN** the summary of the title of the issue has 80 characters
- **THEN** the title of the pull request keeps the type and the scope, and its summary has at most 60 characters

#### Scenario: A scope that no label declares
- **WHEN** the title of the issue is `fix(floor): the job drops a comment` and `.github/labels.yml` declares no `scope/floor`
- **THEN** the title of the pull request is `fix: the job drops a comment`
