# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Every tool call of a step writes one line to the Job log
The agent of a step SHALL write one line to the standard error stream for each tool call, when it ends. The line SHALL hold the name of the tool, the program of the `command` argument when the tool has one, and the outcome: `ok`, `refused`, `retry` or `failed`. The program SHALL be the first word of the command when it is a program of the allowlist or of `IMPLEMENT_SHELL_REPLACEMENTS`, else the word `other`. The outcome `retry` SHALL be followed by the reason that the tool returned, in brackets, when the retry is not a refusal by policy and not a failed validation. The reason SHALL be the message of the `ModelRetry`, with the `path` argument added after it as "Path: <path>" when the message lacks it, also when the message is cut. The `path` argument SHALL show only when it names a file or a directory of the checkout, and "<path>" SHALL show in its place otherwise. The reason SHALL be masked, escaped to one line and cut to `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_LOG_REASON_CHARS` characters. The line SHALL hold nothing else.

#### Scenario: A program of the allowlist
- **WHEN** the model calls a tool with the command `git status`
- **THEN** the line holds "program git"

#### Scenario: A call that returns
- **WHEN** the model calls `write_file` with a path and a content, and then ends its run
- **THEN** the standard error stream holds the line "Tool call: write_file, ok." and holds neither the path nor the content

#### Scenario: A call that fails validation
- **WHEN** the model calls `read_file` without its `path` argument
- **THEN** the standard error stream holds the line "Tool call: read_file, retry."

#### Scenario: A short bare word that is no known program
- **WHEN** the first word of a shell command is a short bare word such as `hunter2password` that the model read from a file
- **THEN** the line and the reason of a stopped run hold "other" and not the word

#### Scenario: A refused path
- **WHEN** the model calls `read_file` with a path outside the root
- **THEN** the standard error stream holds the line "Tool call: read_file, retry." and no part of the path

#### Scenario: A call that the tool reports as failed
- **WHEN** a tool reports a failed call
- **THEN** the standard error stream holds the line "Tool call: <tool>, failed."

#### Scenario: An edit whose old text is missing
- **WHEN** the model calls `edit_file` with an `old_text` that the file does not hold
- **THEN** the line is "Tool call: edit_file, retry (old_text not found in <path>. No changes were written.)." and holds no part of `old_text`

#### Scenario: A retry whose message has no path
- **WHEN** the model calls `edit_file` with a `path` and with neither `old_text` nor `replacements`
- **THEN** the reason in the line ends with "Path: <path>"

#### Scenario: A long reason without the path
- **WHEN** the message of a retry is longer than `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_LOG_REASON_CHARS` and lacks the `path` argument
- **THEN** the reason in the line is cut and ends with "Path: <path>"

#### Scenario: A path that is no file of the checkout
- **WHEN** the `path` argument is a plain string that no file of the checkout has, and the message names it
- **THEN** the line shows "<path>" in its place and holds no part of the string

#### Scenario: A secret in a reason
- **WHEN** the message of a retry holds a GitHub token
- **THEN** the line holds no part of the token

#### Scenario: A long reason
- **WHEN** the message of a retry is longer than `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_LOG_REASON_CHARS`
- **THEN** the reason in the line is cut to that length and ends with " ..."

### Requirement: The reason of a stopped run counts the refused and the retried tool calls
A step that stops on a pydantic-ai error SHALL count the tool calls that a tool refused by its policy, by program, and the tool calls that came back as a retry for another cause. The reason SHALL end with both counts when a count is not zero. It SHALL list at most `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_REFUSED_PROGRAMS` programs, most refused first, and join the rest to `other`. A call counts as refused when it has a shell command and a `PermissionError` is in its `__cause__` chain. When a tool exceeds its retries, the reason SHALL also end with a line that names the tool and holds its last `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_STOP_REASONS` reasons, in the form of the Job log.

#### Scenario: The call that exceeds the limit
- **WHEN** the model is refused more often than `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_TOOL_RETRIES` times
- **THEN** the call that ends the run counts as refused too

#### Scenario: Refused commands
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `pytest tests/test_sample.py` in every reply, and the shell allows only `git`, `uv`, `ruff` and `mypy`
- **THEN** the reason ends with a new line and "Refused commands: pytest 6. Other retries: 0."

#### Scenario: Refused commands of two programs
- **WHEN** the model is refused `python` four times and `cd` twice, and then the run ends
- **THEN** the reason ends with "Refused commands: python 4, cd 2."

#### Scenario: Refused commands of many programs
- **WHEN** the model is refused more distinct programs than `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_REFUSED_PROGRAMS`
- **THEN** the reason lists that number of programs and the count of `other` holds the rest

#### Scenario: Arguments that fail validation
- **WHEN** the model calls the tool `read_file` without its `path` argument in every reply
- **THEN** the reason ends with "Refused commands: 0. Other retries: 6." and holds no reason

#### Scenario: A path outside the root
- **WHEN** the model calls `read_file` with the path `/etc/passwd` in every reply
- **THEN** the reason ends with "Refused commands: 0. Other retries: 6." and holds no reason

#### Scenario: A run with no retry
- **WHEN** the model calls `read_file` with a valid path in every reply until the request limit
- **THEN** the reason holds the message of the error and holds neither count

#### Scenario: A tool that ends the run on retries
- **WHEN** the model calls `edit_file` with an `old_text` that the file does not hold in every reply
- **THEN** the reason ends with a line "Last retries of edit_file: " and the last `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_STOP_REASONS` reasons of that tool

#### Scenario: A run that ends on a limit
- **WHEN** the run ends on the request limit after retries of `edit_file`
- **THEN** the reason holds no line of reasons
