## Purpose

Which caller overrides of the environment of a child process devops-cli refuses, because they make the dynamic loader or the shell of the child load or run code that the caller did not choose, and what a refusal reports.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A caller override that loads code into the child is refused
`build_subprocess_env` SHALL raise `SecurityError` with the message "Prohibited dangerous environment variable override: '<key>'" and the error code `SECURITY_ERROR` when the upper-case form of a key of the caller override is `LD_AUDIT`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `LD_ORIGIN_PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`, `BASH_ENV` or `ENV`, or starts with `DYLD_` or `BASH_FUNC_`. It SHALL do this with environment isolation on and off.

#### Scenario: A glibc audit library
- **WHEN** a caller builds a child environment with the override `LD_AUDIT` or `ld_audit`
- **THEN** `build_subprocess_env` raises `SecurityError` that names the key, with the error code `SECURITY_ERROR`

#### Scenario: A macOS loader key
- **WHEN** a caller builds a child environment with the override `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`, `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH`, in upper or lower case
- **THEN** `build_subprocess_env` raises `SecurityError` that names the key, with the error code `SECURITY_ERROR`

#### Scenario: An exported bash function
- **WHEN** a caller builds a child environment with the override `BASH_FUNC_x%%` or `bash_func_x%%`
- **THEN** `build_subprocess_env` raises `SecurityError` that names the key, with the error code `SECURITY_ERROR`

### Requirement: A caller override outside the refused families reaches the child
`build_subprocess_env` SHALL put each other key of the caller override in the child environment with its value, also a key that contains a refused name but does not start with it.

#### Scenario: Usual keys and keys that look like a refused key
- **WHEN** a caller builds a child environment with the overrides `PATH`, `HOME`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `EXAMPLE_DYLD_FLAG` and `BASH_FUNCTIONS`
- **THEN** the child environment holds each of these keys with its value

### Requirement: The rule pack test gives Semgrep only its own setting
`run_rule_pack_tests` SHALL give `semgrep --version` and `semgrep --test` the override `SEMGREP_ENABLE_VERSION_CHECK=0` and no other key, so the child gets the isolated environment that `build_subprocess_env` builds.

#### Scenario: An exported bash function and a token in the environment of the person
- **WHEN** the environment holds `BASH_FUNC_which%%` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `run_rule_pack_tests` runs on a copy of the rule pack
- **THEN** Semgrep runs, its environment holds `SEMGREP_ENABLE_VERSION_CHECK=0`, and its environment holds neither `BASH_FUNC_which%%` nor `GITHUB_TOKEN`
