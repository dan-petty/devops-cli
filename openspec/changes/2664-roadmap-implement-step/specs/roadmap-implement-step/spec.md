# Spec Delta

## Purpose

What `devops roadmap implement` reads, runs, checks, commits and reports when it runs one task group of a staged change in one bounded context, so that the exit of a step is a fact that the step checks and not a claim of the model.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A step commits its group when the exit checks pass
`devops roadmap implement --item N --group n` SHALL run one agent on group n of the `tasks.md` of the change of item N in the checkout. When the agent returns and every exit check passes, the step SHALL commit the checkout as `<group title> (#N)` and report done with the commit. A step SHALL end done in no other way.

#### Scenario: The agent writes the test and the code
- **WHEN** the model writes a test file and a source file, ticks the tasks of group 1, and ends its run, and the verification command, `ruff` and `mypy` exit 0
- **THEN** the step reports done, the checkout holds one new commit titled `The first group (#7)`, that commit holds the three files, and the tasks of group 1 are ticked in the commit

### Requirement: A failed exit check stops the step and resets the checkout
The exit checks SHALL run in this order: every task of the group is ticked and no other group changed, each verification command of the group passes, and `ruff check`, `ruff format --check` and `mypy --strict` pass on the changed Python files. The step SHALL stop at the first check that fails, SHALL name it as the reason, SHALL make no commit, and SHALL reset the checkout to its last commit.

#### Scenario: A verification command fails
- **WHEN** the model ends its run with the files written and the tasks ticked, and the verification command exits 1
- **THEN** the step reports stopped, the reason names the command and its exit status, the checkout holds no new commit, and the written files are gone

#### Scenario: A static check fails
- **WHEN** the verification command exits 0 and `ruff check` exits 1 on the changed file
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason that `ruff check` failed, makes no commit and resets the checkout

#### Scenario: A task stays unticked
- **WHEN** the model ends its run and leaves a task of the group unticked
- **THEN** the step reports stopped, the reason names the unticked task, no verification command runs, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: The model changes another group
- **WHEN** the model ticks a task of group 2 while it works on group 1
- **THEN** the step reports stopped, the reason names group 2, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: A task that the agent removes
- **WHEN** the model removes a task of group 1 from the `tasks.md` and ticks the others
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason that the tasks of group 1 changed, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: A verification command outside the allowlist
- **WHEN** a Verification line of the group names `curl http://example.com`
- **THEN** the step reports stopped, the reason names `curl` as not allowed, the command does not run, and the checkout is reset

### Requirement: The verification commands of a group are the code spans of its Verification lines
The verification commands of a group SHALL be the code spans of the `Verification:` lines of its tasks, each one once, in the order of the file. The step SHALL run each one in the checkout, and SHALL refuse to run one whose first word is not a program of the shell allowlist.

#### Scenario: Two lines name one command
- **WHEN** two tasks of the group name `uv run devops ci test tests/test_sample.py` and the second names `uv run devops docs check` as well
- **THEN** the step runs `uv run devops ci test tests/test_sample.py` once and `uv run devops docs check` once, in that order

### Requirement: A step refuses an input that does not fit the window
The step SHALL count the tokens of its instructions and its user message before the first model request. When the count is more than the `context_window` of `ai.tasks.implement` minus `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_TURN_RESERVE_TOKENS`, the step SHALL raise `RoadmapImplementError`, SHALL name the measure and the limit in its message, and SHALL make no model request and change nothing in the checkout.

#### Scenario: Inputs over the limit
- **WHEN** the window is 4000 tokens and the packed inputs of the step measure more than the window minus the reserve
- **THEN** the step raises `RoadmapImplementError` with the exit code 1 and the error code `ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_REFUSED`, its message holds the measured tokens and the limit, and the model gets no request

### Requirement: A step refuses a checkout with uncommitted changes
The step SHALL refuse to start when `git status --porcelain` lists a change in the checkout, because a failed step resets the checkout. It SHALL raise `RoadmapImplementError` and make no model request.

#### Scenario: A dirty checkout
- **WHEN** the checkout holds an untracked file
- **THEN** the step raises `RoadmapImplementError` that names the checkout, the model gets no request, and the file stays

### Requirement: The inputs of a step are fixed
The user message of the model SHALL hold the title, the problem statement and the acceptance criteria of the item, the `proposal.md`, `design.md` and `tasks.md` of the change, the group, and the files that the group names, packed. It SHALL hold nothing else. The change is the one folder `openspec/changes/<N>-*/` of the checkout, and the step SHALL raise `RoadmapImplementError` when there is none or more than one.

#### Scenario: The first request
- **WHEN** the step runs group 1 of a change whose group 1 names `src/sample.py` and `tests/test_sample.py`, which does not exist yet
- **THEN** the first request holds the item title, the two sections of the issue, the three documents, the text of group 1 and the packed `src/sample.py`, and it holds no text of another file

#### Scenario: A missing change
- **WHEN** the checkout holds no folder `openspec/changes/7-*/`
- **THEN** the step raises `RoadmapImplementError` that names the pattern

### Requirement: The shell tool admits only the project's programs
The shell tool of the agent SHALL run a command only when its first word is `git`, `uv`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `openspec` or `devops`, and the command holds none of the operators that start a second command. Any other command SHALL come back to the model as a refusal, and the run SHALL go on.

#### Scenario: A program outside the list
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `curl http://example.com`, and then ends its run
- **THEN** the call returns the refusal that `curl` is not in the allowed list, no process starts, and the run ends with the last message of the model

#### Scenario: A second command
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `git status; curl http://example.com`
- **THEN** the call returns a refusal that names the operator, and no process starts

### Requirement: A run that reaches a limit ends stopped
`UsageLimits` SHALL cap a run at `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_MAX_REQUESTS` model requests and `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_MAX_TOOL_CALLS` tool calls. A run that reaches a limit, or that breaks the rules of its tools past their retries, SHALL end as stopped with the class name of the pydantic-ai error as the reason, and the step SHALL reset the checkout. The agent SHALL have no `delegate_task` tool.

#### Scenario: A model that never ends
- **WHEN** the model calls a tool in every reply
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason `UsageLimitExceeded`, the model got `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_MAX_REQUESTS` requests at most, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: The tools of the agent
- **WHEN** the step makes its first request
- **THEN** the function tools offered are `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_files`, `grep` and `shell`

### Requirement: The step writes nothing to GitHub and a dry run makes no request
The step SHALL read the item once and SHALL write no issue, comment, label or milestone. With `--dry-run` it SHALL make no request of any kind, SHALL start no model run, SHALL change nothing in the checkout, and SHALL return a `StepOutcome` marked as a dry run that lists the requests a run makes.

#### Scenario: A dry run
- **WHEN** `devops roadmap implement --item 7 --group 1 --dry-run` runs
- **THEN** the command exits 0, it prints the read of issue 7 and the model requests, the model gets no request, and the roadmap store sees no read

### Requirement: The outcome is a structured report
The step SHALL return a `StepOutcome` with the status (done or stopped), the reason, the last message of the agent, the commit, and the requests and tokens that the run spent. The command SHALL print it as a table, or as JSON with `--format json`, and SHALL exit 1 when the status is stopped. The step SHALL record the spend of the run as one record of the spend ledger.

#### Scenario: A stopped step as JSON
- **WHEN** a step stops on a failed verification and the command runs with `--format json`
- **THEN** the output is one JSON object with `status` `stopped`, the reason, an empty `commit`, and the counts of requests and tokens, and the exit code is 1

#### Scenario: The spend record
- **WHEN** a step ends after two model requests
- **THEN** the spend ledger holds one record for the run with the sum of the tokens of the two replies
