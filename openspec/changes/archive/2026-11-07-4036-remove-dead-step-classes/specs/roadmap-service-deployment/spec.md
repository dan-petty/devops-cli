## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The implement job runs on a hosted gateway group
The ConfigMap template `k8s/devops/configmap.example.yaml` SHALL set the model of `ai.tasks.implement` and the one tier of each step class of `roadmap.implement.ladder` to a hosted group that `k8s/llm/gateway/config.yaml` serves. The `context_window` of the task SHALL NOT be above the `max_input_tokens` of that group, and SHALL hold the default step budget with the turn reserve.

#### Scenario: The template is read
- **WHEN** the template is validated as settings and the gateway config is read
- **THEN** the model of the task `implement` and each tier of each step class are a hosted group in the `model_list` of the gateway config, and the two step classes have a ladder

#### Scenario: The window fits
- **WHEN** the window of the task `implement` is compared with the window of its group and with the step budget plus the turn reserve
- **THEN** the window is not above the window of the group and is not below the step budget plus the turn reserve
