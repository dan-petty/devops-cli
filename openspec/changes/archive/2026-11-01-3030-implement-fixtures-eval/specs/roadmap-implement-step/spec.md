## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The outcome is a structured report
The step SHALL return a `StepOutcome` with the status (done or stopped), the reason, the last message of the agent, the commit, and the requests, the tool calls and the tokens that the run spent. The command SHALL print it as a table, or as JSON with `--format json`, and SHALL exit 1 when the status is stopped. The step SHALL record the spend of the run as one record of the spend ledger.

#### Scenario: A stopped step as JSON
- **WHEN** a step stops on a failed verification and the command runs with `--format json`
- **THEN** the output is one JSON object with `status` `stopped`, the reason, an empty `commit`, and the counts of requests, tool calls and tokens, and the exit code is 1

#### Scenario: The spend record
- **WHEN** a step ends after two model requests
- **THEN** the spend ledger holds one record for the run with the sum of the tokens of the two replies

#### Scenario: The tool calls
- **WHEN** a step ends after three tool calls in two replies
- **THEN** the outcome holds `tool_calls` 3
