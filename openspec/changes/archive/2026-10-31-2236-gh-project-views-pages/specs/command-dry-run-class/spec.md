# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: gh-project-views-pages-request-plans
The ten external-request commands in `gh project`, `gh views`, and `gh pages` SHALL carry the `request-plan` dry-run class. Each command SHALL expose `--dry-run`, make zero external requests during a dry run, and output its planned requests.

#### Scenario: Dry run on gh pages build
- **WHEN** user executes `devops gh pages build --dry-run`
- **THEN** no external request is made and the planned build request is printed

#### Scenario: Dry run on gh project sync
- **WHEN** user executes `devops gh project sync --dry-run`
- **THEN** no external request is made and the planned board, field, and view requests are printed

### Requirement: gh-project-views-pages-no-external-request
The five local commands in `gh project`, `gh views`, and `gh pages` SHALL carry the `no-external-request` dry-run class, allowing execution under `devops --dry-run <command>` without external requests.

#### Scenario: Dry run on local command gh views list
- **WHEN** user executes `devops --dry-run gh views list`
- **THEN** the command executes locally and renders the standardized views table
