## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The plan names files that exist at the staged commit
The job SHALL check each path of the reply against the tracked files of the staged commit: the paths of `reads` and `changes`, the paths in the code spans of the tasks, and the paths in `verify`. A path SHALL pass when the commit holds it, or when `creates` of its group or of an earlier group lists it. A missing path SHALL go back to the model once, with the files of the commit that have the same file name. A second reply with a missing path SHALL stop the item and open no draft pull request.

#### Scenario: A test file that moved
- **WHEN** a group changes `tests/test_scanner_tool_executor.py` and the commit holds `tests/security/test_scanner_tool_executor.py`
- **THEN** the job asks the model again, and the problem names the missing path and lists `tests/security/test_scanner_tool_executor.py`

#### Scenario: The second reply has a missing path
- **WHEN** the second reply still names `tests/test_scanner_tool_executor.py`
- **THEN** the job stops the item with the problem, pushes no branch and opens no draft pull request

#### Scenario: A path in a task or in a verify command
- **WHEN** a code span of a task or the `verify` command of a group names a file that the commit lacks and no group up to it creates
- **THEN** the problem names that file

#### Scenario: A created path
- **WHEN** a group changes `tests/test_new.py`, lists it in `creates`, and a later group reads it
- **THEN** the job finds no missing path
- **AND** when only a later group lists it in `creates`, the earlier group names a missing path

#### Scenario: A word that is no path
- **WHEN** a code span holds `status/blocked`, `--strict` or `uv run devops ci docs`
- **THEN** the job finds no missing path

#### Scenario: A name with no folder
- **WHEN** a code span of a task or the `verify` command holds `ruff.toml` or `grep step_files.py`
- **THEN** the job finds no missing path
- **AND** a path of `reads` or `changes` with no folder is still checked

### Requirement: The comment and the record of a staged item
The job SHALL post one comment on the issue with the marker `<!-- devops roadmap stage -->` that names the branch, the pull request, the groups with their measures and the budget. The job SHALL record `stage.branch`, `stage.pr`, `stage.sha` and `stage.groups` in the job record. The job SHALL NOT change the Status of the item.

#### Scenario: The comment and the record
- **WHEN** the job stages a Ready bug
- **THEN** the issue gets one comment with the marker, the record holds the four keys, and the Status is still Ready

#### Scenario: A title with no type
- **WHEN** the title of the item has no Conventional Commit type
- **THEN** the plan leaves the item out and says that its title has no type

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: A staged item gets one comment and a record
**Reason**: The comment named each path that is no file on the default branch, and the job staged the item anyway. The job now returns such a plan to the model, so a staged plan holds no missing path and the comment has nothing to name.
**Migration**: The requirement "The comment and the record of a staged item" holds the rest. The requirement "The plan names files that exist at the staged commit" holds the check.
