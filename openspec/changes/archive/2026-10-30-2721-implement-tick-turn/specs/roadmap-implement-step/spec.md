# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A failed exit check stops the step and resets the checkout
The exit checks SHALL run in this order: the group changed only in its checkboxes and no other group changed, each verification command passes, the static checks pass, and every task of the group is ticked. The step SHALL stop at the first check that fails, name it as the reason, make no commit, and reset the checkout. A task left unticked after the first three checks first gets the extra turn of the requirement "A step asks once for the missing ticks".

#### Scenario: A verification command fails
- **WHEN** the model ends its run with the files written and the tasks ticked, and the verification command exits 1
- **THEN** the step reports stopped, the reason names the command and its exit status, the checkout holds no new commit, and the written files are gone

#### Scenario: A static check fails
- **WHEN** the verification command exits 0 and `ruff check` exits 1 on the changed file
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason that `ruff check` failed, makes no commit and resets the checkout

#### Scenario: A task stays unticked
- **WHEN** the model ends its run and leaves a task of the group unticked, the verification command and the static checks exit 0, and the extra turn leaves the task unticked
- **THEN** the step reports stopped, the reason names the unticked task, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: A task stays unticked and a verification command fails
- **WHEN** the model ends its run and leaves a task of the group unticked, and the verification command exits 1
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason that names the command and its exit status, the model gets no extra turn, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: The model changes another group
- **WHEN** the model ticks a task of group 2 while it works on group 1
- **THEN** the step reports stopped, the reason names group 2, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: A task that the agent removes
- **WHEN** the model removes a task of group 1 from the `tasks.md` and ticks the others
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason that the tasks of group 1 changed, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: A tasks file that is gone
- **WHEN** the model removes the `tasks.md` of the change
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason that the tasks of group 1 changed, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: A verification command outside the allowlist
- **WHEN** a Verification line of the group names `curl http://example.com`
- **THEN** the step reports stopped, the reason names `curl` as not allowed, the command does not run, and the checkout is reset

### Requirement: The inputs of a step are fixed
The user message of the model SHALL hold the title, problem statement and acceptance criteria of the item, the `proposal.md`, `design.md` and `tasks.md` of the change, the group, the files that the group names, packed, and, except for a fix step, the path of the `tasks.md` under the heading "The tasks file". It SHALL hold nothing else. The change is the one folder `openspec/changes/<N>-*/` of the checkout, and the step SHALL raise `RoadmapImplementError` when there is none or more than one.

#### Scenario: The first request
- **WHEN** the step runs group 1 of a change whose group 1 names `src/sample.py` and `tests/test_sample.py`, which does not exist yet
- **THEN** the first request holds the item title, the two sections of the issue, the three documents, the text of group 1, the packed `src/sample.py` and the path `openspec/changes/1-sample-change/tasks.md`, and it holds no text of another file

#### Scenario: A fix step
- **WHEN** a fix step builds its inputs
- **THEN** the message holds no section "The tasks file"

#### Scenario: A missing change
- **WHEN** the checkout holds no folder `openspec/changes/7-*/`
- **THEN** the step raises `RoadmapImplementError` that names the pattern

### Requirement: A run that reaches a limit ends stopped
`UsageLimits` SHALL cap a run at `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_MAX_REQUESTS` model requests and `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_MAX_TOOL_CALLS` tool calls, and the extra turn for the ticks SHALL count against them. A run that reaches a limit, or breaks the rules of its tools past their retries, SHALL end as stopped with the class name of the pydantic-ai error as the reason, and the step SHALL reset the checkout. The agent SHALL have no `delegate_task` tool.

#### Scenario: A model that never ends
- **WHEN** the model calls a tool in every reply
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason `UsageLimitExceeded`, the model got `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_MAX_REQUESTS` requests at most, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: A model that calls too many tools
- **WHEN** the model calls more tools than `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_MAX_TOOL_CALLS` before it reaches the request limit
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason `UsageLimitExceeded`, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: The tools of the agent
- **WHEN** the step makes its first request
- **THEN** the function tools offered are `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_files`, `grep` and `shell`

#### Scenario: The extra turn shares the budget
- **WHEN** the first turn used all but one of the model requests and the extra turn needs two
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason `UsageLimitExceeded`, and the model got `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_MAX_REQUESTS` requests at most over both turns

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A step asks once for the missing ticks
When the agent ends its run, the group changed only in its checkboxes, no other group changed, each verification command passes, the static checks pass, and a task of the group is unticked, the step SHALL run one more model turn. The turn SHALL continue the same conversation under the same `UsageLimits`. Its message SHALL name the path of the `tasks.md` and list the unticked tasks, and SHALL ask only for their ticks. The step SHALL run the turn at most once, and SHALL run none for a fix step.

#### Scenario: The agent forgot the ticks
- **WHEN** the model writes a test file and a source file, ends its run with the tasks of group 1 unticked, the verification command and the static checks exit 0, and the model ticks the tasks in the extra turn
- **THEN** the step reports done, the extra turn got the list of the unticked tasks, the new commit holds the test file, the source file and the ticked `tasks.md`, and the verification command ran twice

#### Scenario: The turn ticks nothing
- **WHEN** the model ends the extra turn and leaves the task unticked
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason that names the unticked task, and the model got no third turn

#### Scenario: A fix step
- **WHEN** a fix step ends with a changed file and no ticks
- **THEN** the step commits the fix and the model gets no extra turn

### Requirement: The turn for the ticks changes only the tasks file
The extra turn SHALL change no file except the `tasks.md` of the change. The step SHALL check this with git, by comparing the checkout after the turn with the tree of the checkout before it, and SHALL stop with a reason that names the other paths when the turn changed any. After the turn every exit check SHALL run again. The outcome SHALL count the requests and the tokens of both turns, and the spend ledger SHALL hold the replies of both.

#### Scenario: The turn changes another file
- **WHEN** the model changes `src/sample.py` in the extra turn
- **THEN** the step reports stopped with the reason that names `src/sample.py`, makes no commit and resets the checkout

#### Scenario: The turn ticks a task of another group
- **WHEN** the model unticks a task of group 2 in the extra turn
- **THEN** the step reports stopped, the reason names group 2, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: The spend of two turns
- **WHEN** the first turn took two model requests and the extra turn took one
- **THEN** the outcome reports three requests, and the spend ledger holds the tokens of the three replies

### Requirement: A stopped step reports a masked diff of its discarded work
A step that ends as stopped SHALL read the diff of the work that it discards, from the commit where it started to the checkout, with the new files included and without any external diff program or text conversion. It SHALL mask secrets in the whole diff with `mask_secrets` first, then cut it to `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_DIFF_CHARS` characters. The `StepOutcome` SHALL hold the result as `diff`, and SHALL set `diff_cut` when it cut the diff. A done step SHALL report an empty diff.

#### Scenario: A stop after the agent wrote files
- **WHEN** the agent writes `src/sample.py` and a new test file, and the step stops on a failed verification command
- **THEN** the outcome holds a diff that names both files and holds their new lines, and the checkout is reset

#### Scenario: A long diff
- **WHEN** the discarded work is longer than `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_DIFF_CHARS` characters
- **THEN** the diff of the outcome is exactly that long and `diff_cut` is true

#### Scenario: A secret in the diff
- **WHEN** the agent writes a line that holds a token in the form of a GitHub token and the step stops
- **THEN** the diff of the outcome holds the mask in place of the token

#### Scenario: A done step
- **WHEN** the step ends done
- **THEN** its diff is empty and `diff_cut` is false
