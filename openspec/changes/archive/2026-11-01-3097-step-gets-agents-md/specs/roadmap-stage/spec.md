## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The job measures each task group
The job SHALL measure each task group with tiktoken: the tokens of the group's instructions, the item, the change folder, the `AGENTS.md` of the repository, the routed sections of its documents, and the files that the tasks of the group name in code spans, each packed as the implement step packs it, at most `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_FILE_MAX_TOKENS` tokens. The budget SHALL be `roadmap.stage.step_tokens`, default 40000, and `--step-tokens` SHALL override it for one run.

#### Scenario: A group is measured
- **WHEN** the model gives a group whose task names a file of the repository
- **THEN** the comment on the issue gives the group's measure, and that measure is more than the tokens of the file packed

#### Scenario: A large file counts as the step reads it
- **WHEN** a task of a group names one file that holds more tokens than the budget
- **THEN** the group measure is under the budget, and the job asks the model for no split

#### Scenario: A file that no task names
- **WHEN** the `Reads:` line of a group lists a file that no task of the group names
- **THEN** the file adds no token to the measure, as the step does not read it

#### Scenario: The rules count
- **WHEN** the repository holds an `AGENTS.md` and a group names `tests/test_sample.py`
- **THEN** the measure of the group holds the tokens of the `AGENTS.md` and of the routed sections of `docs/TESTING.md`
