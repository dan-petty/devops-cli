# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A command span holds no process.command_line
Each command span SHALL hold the name of its command in `cli.command`, and SHALL hold no `process.command_line`. The span of the command that runs SHALL hold its command path in `cli.command_path`.

#### Scenario: A person runs a command of a command group
- **WHEN** a person runs `devops <group> set <key> <value>` with telemetry export on
- **THEN** the span `cli.<group>` holds the `cli.command` `<group>`, and the span `cli.set` holds the `cli.command` `set` and the `cli.command_path` `devops <group> set`
- **AND** neither span holds `process.command_line`
