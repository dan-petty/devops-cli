# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The shell tool admits only the project's programs
The shell tool of the agent SHALL run a command only when its first word is `git`, `uv`, `ruff` or `mypy`, and the command holds none of the operators that start a second command. Any other command SHALL come back to the model as a refusal, and the run SHALL go on. The refusal SHALL keep the text of the shell tool, cut to `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_ERROR_CHARS` characters, and SHALL add a hint. The shell SHALL run with `HOME` set to a temporary directory. The shell is no security boundary.

#### Scenario: A program outside the list
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `curl http://example.com`, and then ends its run
- **THEN** the call returns the refusal that `curl` is not in the allowed list followed by the list of the allowed programs, no process starts, and the run ends with the last message of the model

#### Scenario: The devops command
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `devops gh api -X POST repos/example/roadmap/issues`
- **THEN** the call returns the refusal that `devops` is not in the allowed list, and no process starts

#### Scenario: A second command
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `git status; curl http://example.com`
- **THEN** the call returns a refusal that names the operator and states the rule of one command in each call, and no process starts

#### Scenario: A habit of the table
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `python -m pytest`
- **THEN** the refusal holds "Instead of `python`: `uv run python`" and says that `python -m pip` is not to run, and no process starts

#### Scenario: A long word
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with a first word of 5000 characters
- **THEN** the refusal holds the text of the shell cut to `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_ERROR_CHARS` characters, then the hint

#### Scenario: A file command
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `cat README.md`
- **THEN** the refusal names the tool `read_file`

#### Scenario: A change of directory
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `cd src`
- **THEN** the refusal says that `cd` is not needed because every command runs in the checkout

#### Scenario: The retry limit is unchanged
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `python -V` in every reply
- **THEN** the model got five refusals with a hint, and the sixth call ends the run as before

#### Scenario: The prompt and the table agree
- **WHEN** the table `IMPLEMENT_SHELL_REPLACEMENTS` or `IMPLEMENT_SHELL_PROGRAMS` differs from the prompt of the step, or a shell command of the prompt holds an operator that the shell refuses
- **THEN** a test fails

### Requirement: The reason of a stopped run counts the refused and the retried tool calls
A step that stops on a pydantic-ai error SHALL count the tool calls that a tool refused by its policy, by program, and the tool calls that came back as a retry for another cause. The reason SHALL end with both counts when a count is not zero. It SHALL list at most `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_REFUSED_PROGRAMS` programs, most refused first, and join the rest to `other`. A call counts as refused when it has a shell command and a `PermissionError` is in its `__cause__` chain.

#### Scenario: The call that exceeds the limit
- **WHEN** the model is refused more often than `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_TOOL_RETRIES` times
- **THEN** the call that ends the run counts as refused too

#### Scenario: Refused commands
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `pytest tests/test_sample.py` in every reply, and the shell allows only `git`, `uv`, `ruff` and `mypy`
- **THEN** the reason ends with a new line and "Refused commands: pytest 6. Other retries: 0."

#### Scenario: Refused commands of two programs
- **WHEN** the model is refused `python` four times and `cd` twice, and then the run ends
- **THEN** the reason ends with "Refused commands: python 4, cd 2."

#### Scenario: Refused commands of many programs
- **WHEN** the model is refused more distinct programs than `CONST_ROADMAP_IMPLEMENT_REFUSED_PROGRAMS`
- **THEN** the reason lists that number of programs and the count of `other` holds the rest

#### Scenario: Arguments that fail validation
- **WHEN** the model calls the tool `read_file` without its `path` argument in every reply
- **THEN** the reason ends with "Refused commands: 0. Other retries: 6."

#### Scenario: A path outside the root
- **WHEN** the model calls `read_file` with the path `/etc/passwd` in every reply
- **THEN** the reason ends with "Refused commands: 0. Other retries: 6."

#### Scenario: A run with no retry
- **WHEN** the model calls `read_file` with a valid path in every reply until the request limit
- **THEN** the reason holds the message of the error and holds neither count

### Requirement: Every tool call of a step writes one line to the Job log
The agent of a step SHALL write one line to the standard error stream for each tool call. The line SHALL hold the name of the tool, the program of the `command` argument when the tool has one, and the outcome: `ok`, `refused`, `retry` or `failed`. The program SHALL be the first word of the command when it is a program of the allowlist or a program of `IMPLEMENT_SHELL_REPLACEMENTS`, else the word `other`. The line SHALL hold nothing else.

#### Scenario: A refused program
- **WHEN** the model calls the shell tool with `pytest tests/test_sample.py --secret-flag=abc`, and then ends its run
- **THEN** the standard error stream holds the line "Tool call: shell, program pytest, refused." and holds no text of the arguments

#### Scenario: A program of the allowlist
- **WHEN** the model calls a tool with the command `git status`
- **THEN** the line holds "program git"

#### Scenario: A call that returns
- **WHEN** the model calls `write_file` with a path and a content, and then ends its run
- **THEN** the standard error stream holds the line "Tool call: write_file, ok." and holds neither the path nor the content

#### Scenario: A call that fails validation
- **WHEN** the model calls `read_file` without its `path` argument
- **THEN** the standard error stream holds the line "Tool call: read_file, retry."

#### Scenario: A first word that is no program
- **WHEN** the first word of a shell command is an assignment such as `API_KEY=hunter2`, a path, a word with a space or a quote, an escape sequence, or the command has an unclosed quote
- **THEN** the line holds "program other" and holds no part of the word

#### Scenario: A short bare word that is no known program
- **WHEN** the first word of a shell command is a short bare word such as `hunter2password` that the model read from a file
- **THEN** the line and the reason of a stopped run hold "other" and not the word

#### Scenario: A refused path
- **WHEN** the model calls `read_file` with a path outside the root
- **THEN** the standard error stream holds the line "Tool call: read_file, retry."

#### Scenario: A call that the tool reports as failed
- **WHEN** a tool reports a failed call
- **THEN** the standard error stream holds the line "Tool call: <tool>, failed."
