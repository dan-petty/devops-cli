## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The pull request that delivers the code has the type of the issue
The job SHALL set the title of the pull request, for a Staged item and for a Planned item, to the type and the scope of the title of the issue and its whole summary. Before it writes the title, the job SHALL check it with the form of the pull request and SHALL stop the item when the form refuses it. The job SHALL leave out the scope when `.github/labels.yml` on the default branch declares no label `scope/<scope>`. The job SHALL set the title in the same call that sets the body `Closes #<issue>`.

#### Scenario: A Staged item
- **WHEN** the staging pull request of a bug has the title `docs(openspec): plan #1 keep every comment` and the job finishes the change
- **THEN** the title of the pull request becomes `fix(roadmap): the job drops a comment`, the title of the issue

#### Scenario: A summary at the limit
- **WHEN** the summary of the title of the issue is 60 UTF-16 code units
- **THEN** the form accepts the title, and the job writes it unchanged

#### Scenario: A long summary
- **WHEN** the summary of the title of the issue is 61 UTF-16 code units
- **THEN** the job stops the item, and the title of the pull request is not written

#### Scenario: A summary of emoji over the limit
- **WHEN** the summary of the title of the issue is 40 emoji of one code point each, which is 80 UTF-16 code units
- **THEN** the job stops the item, and the title of the pull request is not written

#### Scenario: A scope that no label declares
- **WHEN** the title of the issue is `fix(floor): the job drops a comment` and `.github/labels.yml` declares no `scope/floor`
- **THEN** the title of the pull request is `fix: the job drops a comment`
